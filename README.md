# ToDoList

In this project, the user can create their own to-do list.
They can create and delete their to-do items.

In the background, all to-do list items' information is stored in a database called todoDB using MongoDB Atlas. 
Dynamic manipulations of to-do list items are made possible by using a npm packaged called ejs to retrieve to-do list items and determine which to-do list items are deleted by the user.

Also this app is hosted on Heroku.
